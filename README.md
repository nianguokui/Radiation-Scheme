# Radiation-Scheme
Radiation scheme is the most expensive scheme in physical parameterization schemes, so the overall framework of this scheme is very important for the computational efficiency of atmospheric model. This code integrates a radiation calculation model desinged by Dr. Liou KuoNan, including input, subroutine calling, and an output module which is based on parallel calculation.
